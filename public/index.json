With the current setup, all incoming traffic on the standard, non-securized, HTTP port is anserwered by Nginx, which passes it to the web application on the Instance. For security reasons, it is recommended to add an encryption layer with TLS/SSL and to use HTTPS. Whilst it is technically possible to use self-signed certificates, it may cause inconveniences as a warning is displayed by default in a user’s web browser when a self-signed certificate is used. A certificate authenticity (CA) can issue trusted certificates which are recognized by most modern web browsers. The CA Let’s Encrypt provides TLS certificates for free and the configuration of Nginx can be done easily with Certbot , a tool provided by the EFF . Install Certbot on your Instance by using the APT packet manager: apt-get update apt-get install software-properties-common add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot apt-get update apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx Certbot provides a plugin designed for the Nginx web server, automatizing most of the configuration work related with requesting, installing and managing the TLS certificate: certbot --nginx Answer the prompts that display on the screen to request a valid Let’s Encrypt TLS certificate: Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log Plugins selected: Authenticator nginx, Installer nginx Which names would you like to activate HTTPS for? - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1: your.domain.com - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Select the appropriate numbers separated by commas and/ or spaces, or leave input blank to select all options shown (Enter 'c' to cancel): 1 Obtaining a new certificate Performing the following challenges:http-01 challenge for your.domain.com Waiting for verification...Cleaning up challenges Deploying Certificate to VirtualHost /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/reverse-proxy.conf Please choose whether or not to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, removing HTTP access. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 1: No redirect - Make no further changes to the webserver configuration. 2: Redirect - Make all requests redirect to secure HTTPS access.

The following example shows common parameters used in nginx.conf with a reverse proxy configuration: location/ { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000; proxy_http_version 1.1; proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade; proxy_set_header Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Port $server_port; } Where: proxy_http_version - Defines the HTTP protocol version (the default is set to 1.0) proxy_cache_bypass - This configuration allows responses to bypass cache. Host $host - The $host variable contains, in order of precedence: the host name from the request line, or the host name from the “Host” request header field, or the server name matching a request. X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for - Defines the address of the client connected to the proxy. X-Real-IP $remote_addr - Contains the client IP address. It forwards the real visitor remote IP address to the proxied server. X-Forwarded-Host $host - Defines the original host requested by the client. X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme - If defined in an HTTPS server block, the HTTP responses from the proxied server are rewritten to HTTPS.

Control Resources and limits To prevent potential DoS attacks on nginx, you can set buffer size limitations for all clients. You can do this in the nginx configuration file using the following directives: client_body_buffer_size – use this directive to specify the client request body buffer size. The default value is 8k or 16k but it is recommended to set this as low as 1k: client_body_buffer_size 1k. client_header_buffer_size – use this directive to specify the header buffer size for the client request header. A buffer size of 1k is adequate for most requests. client_max_body_size – use this directive to specify the maximum accepted body size for a client request. A 1k directive should be sufficient but you need to increase it if you are receiving file uploads via the POST method. large_client_header_buffers – use this directive to specify the maximum number and size of buffers to be used to read large client request headers. A large_client_header_buffers 2 1k directive sets the maximum number of buffers to 2, each with a maximum size of 1k. This directive will accept 2 kB data URI. Note: Some sources suggest that setting such limits may prevent potential buffer overflow attacks if such vulnerabilities are found in nginx.

Its functionalities include filtering, server identity masking, and null-byte attack prevention. The module also lets you perform real-time traffic monitoring. We recommend that you follow the ModSecurity manual to install the mod_security module in order to strengthen your security options. Note that if ModSecurity does not meet your needs, you can also use other free WAF solutions .

Set up and configure nginx access and error logs The nginx access and error logs are enabled by default and are located in logs/error.log and logs/access.log respectively. If you want to change the location, you can use the error_log directive in the nginx configuration file. You can also use this directive to specify the logs that will be recorded according to their severity level. For example, a crit severity level will cause nginx to log critical issues and all issues that have a higher severity level than crit. To set the severity level to crit, set the error_log directive as follows: error_log logs/error.log crit; You can find a complete list of error_log severity levels in official nginx documentation . You can also modify the access_log directive in the nginx configuration file to specify a non-default location for access logs. Finally, you can use the log_format directive to configure the format of the logged messages as explained in nginx documentation .

Configure nginx to include security headers To additionally harden your nginx web server, you can add several different HTTP headers. Here are some of the options that we recommend. X-Frame-Options You use the X-Frame-Options HTTP response header to indicate if a browser should be allowed to render a page in a \u003cframe\u003e or an \u003ciframe\u003e. This could prevent clickjacking attacks. Therefore, we recommend that you enable this option for your nginx server. To do this, add the following parameter to the nginx configuration file in the server section: add_header X-Frame-Options \"SAMEORIGIN\"; Strict-Transport-Security HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a method used by websites to declare that they should only be accessed using a secure connection (HTTPS). If a website declares an HSTS policy, the browser must refuse all HTTP connections and prevent users from accepting insecure SSL certificates. To add an HSTS header to your nginx server, you can add the following directive to your server section: add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=31536000; includeSubdomains; preload\"; CSP and X-XSS-Protection Content Security Policy (CSP) protects your web server against certain types of attacks, including Cross-site Scripting attacks (XSS) and data injection attacks. You can implement CSP by adding the following example Content-Security-Policy header (note that the actual header should be configured to match your unique requirements): add_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self' http: https: data: blob: 'unsafe-inline'\" always; The HTTP X-XSS-Protection header is supported by IE and Safari and is not necessary for modern browsers if you have a strong Content Security Policy. However, to help prevent XSS in the case of older browsers (that don’t support CSP yet), you can add the X-XSS Protection header to your server section: add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\"; ","date":"2022-10-06","objectID":"/nginx-reverse-proxy/:7:7","tags":["web server","reverse-proxy","proxy","nginx"],"title":"Nginx Reverse Proxy","uri":"/nginx-reverse-proxy/"},{"categories":["documentation"],"content":"Step 8. Configure SSL and Cipher suites The default configuration of nginx allows you to use insecure old versions of the TLS protocol (according to the official documentation : ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2). This may lead to attacks such as the BEAST attack . Therefore, we recommend that you do not use old TLS protocols and change your configuration to support only newer, secure TLS versions. To do this, add the following directive in the server section of the nginx configuration file: ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3; Additionally, you should specify cipher suites to make sure that no vulnerable suites are supported. To select the best cipher suites, read our article on TLS cipher hardening and add a ssl_ciphers directive to the server section to select the ciphers (as suggested in the article on cipher hardening ). We also recommend that you add the following directive to the server section: ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on; This directive will let the decision on which ciphers to use be made server-side not client-side.
